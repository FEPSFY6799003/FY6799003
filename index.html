      As with all technology, batteries have been constantly improving, becoming safer and better over time. However, as other technologies advance and have higher power requirements, better batteries are needed to meet these demands. Several substances hold the potential to replace lithium, but perhaps the most prominent of them is calcium. Experimentally shown to have a specific capacity of 1337 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), slightly higher than current lithium-ion batteries with 372 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), and a higher abundance of calcium (Xu, 2021) means they would also be cheaper than lithium, despite the drawback of few suitable electrolytes limiting experimentation. Alternatives include magnesium, aluminium, and zinc-ions, each shown to have their own advantages and drawbacks when compared to lithium, and any of them could very well become the mainstream material in batteries depending on how research advances.

      Substances in batteries are considered by their energy/power density (capacity), the charge/discharge rate, the loss of capacity per each recharge (lifespan), and its performance at different temperatures. These factors differ across chosen substances, and so research into this subject has lasted for decades, starting with heavy and dangerous lead-acid batteries before moving to a predominantly lithium-ion battery industry especially in handheld and portable electronics. However, lithium still has its own drawbacks – despite its high capacity and long lifespan even when it is not used for extended periods of time, they pose fire hazards, and lithium is a somewhat limited resource; it is possible to draw lithium from sea water, where it is significantly more abundant compared to the earth’s crust, but it is an expensive process. As such, research into possible replacements for lithium-ions has accelerated over time, with advancements in scientific understanding and improvements in technology has increased the boundaries of possibility, most notably in calcium-ions.

      As a brief explanation, there are two parts to a battery – the cathode and the anode. The metal, such as lithium, acts as the cathode as it loses its electrons, meanwhile another material will act as the anode to attract the electrons to it. The most common anode in lithium-ion batteries nowadays is graphite, as it is cheap with a relatively high energy density. This cathode-anode relationship is also why some materials, despite being theoretically great for a battery, are not used – only specific anodes can be used with them. This is also why despite lithium having a specific capacity of 3861 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), it is the graphite which has 372 mAh per gram, and as such limits it. Other anodes for lithium are being researched as well, but currently the cheapest and easiest is graphite despite its limited specific charge. Given the structure of calcium atoms, they can hold twice as much charge as a lithium atom since they have 2 electrons that they can lose, while lithium only has one, and on top of that they both also lose electrons at similar voltages, with calcium only needing 0.17V extra. Atoms which can lose 2 electrons are superior, as they still only need 1 anode, meaning capacity is theoretically doubled without major change in mass or volume, despite how only certain substances are able to lose 2 electrons.
