      As with all technology, batteries have been constantly improving, becoming safer and better over time. However, as other technologies advance and have higher power requirements, better batteries are needed to meet these demands. Several substances hold the potential to replace lithium, but perhaps the most prominent of them is calcium. Experimentally shown to have a specific capacity of 1337 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), slightly higher than current lithium-ion batteries with 372 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), and a higher abundance of calcium (Xu, 2021) means they would also be cheaper than lithium, despite the drawback of few suitable electrolytes limiting experimentation. Alternatives include magnesium, aluminium, and zinc-ions, each shown to have their own advantages and drawbacks when compared to lithium, and any of them could very well become the mainstream material in batteries depending on how research advances.     </p>
    <h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      Batteries have four main parts; the anode which receives ions and acts as the “negative” terminal (Warner, 2015), the cathode which releases ions and acts as the “positive” terminal (Warner, 2015), the separator which the ions flow through without letting the cathode and anode make contact with each other (Warner, 2015), and the electrolyte which allows this flow of ions and uses it to create a current, powering the circuit that the battery is connected to (Warner, 2015). Figure 1 shows a simple diagram of this layout. This combination of cathode and anode is known as an electrode, and many electrodes are used to create a battery by wrapping them in a cylinder with many layers (Warner, 2015). Nowadays, the five most commonly used lithium-ion cathode chemistries are lithium-iron phosphate (LFP), lithium-manganese oxide (LMO), lithium titanate (LTO), lithium-cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt aluminium (NCA), and finally lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) (Warner, 2015). Each chemistry has its own advantages and disadvantages compared to the other four, ranging from its capacity to operating temperatures to price of production, meaning manufacturers often use them according to the required product and situation. For example, LFP is commonly used in automotives due to its high charge and discharge rates, relatively low cost of production, and high durability which makes it safer than other cathode chemistries available, despite its lower capacity (Warner, 2015). In terms of portable devices, LMO is a strong choice due to its high capacity and charge/discharge rates despite its shorter lifespan (Warner, 2015).
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      Thanks to a combination of higher capacity and voltage, and a longer lifespan than its predecessor – lead acid batteries – it quickly took over the battery market (Warner, 2015). While lead acid has a capacity and voltage of between 15-20 mAh per gram (Warner, 2015) and 2.0V (Warner, 2015), lithium-ions had a capacity of 3861 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021) and voltages ranging from 2.2-3.8V (Warner, 2015), a massive increase which meant longer lifespans for devices at much lower mass and size. Additionally, there was a longer lifespan with over 1000 cycles in almost all cathode chemistries with lithium-ions (Warner, 2015) compared to lead acid’s lifespan of 300-800 (Warner, 2015) cycles. This leap in battery technology greatly improved the capabilities of electronic devices, especially in the field of portable electronics due to the decreased mass of the batteries alongside a far greater capacity and lifespan. However, lithium is reaching its limits in terms of energy density and capacity (Gummow, 2018), and lithium also has plenty of other concerns such as availability, price, and safety (Chae, 2021). As such, research is being intensified in the search for practical replacements to keep advancing battery technology.

    <p class="ex1">
      Possibly the most prominent candidate to replace lithium-ions are calcium-ions. On paper, calcium can hold double the capacity of lithium due to its ability to lose two electrons, compared to only one in the case of lithium (Chae, 2021), as well as the much higher availability of calcium compared to lithium making it cheaper to procure (Chae, 2021). However, as Chae would continue to explain, we are still limited by the lack of suitable cathode materials, likely because there is little understanding of how ions flow into and out of calcium. Despite this, there are several promising options, one of which being layered iron vanadate as the cathode material (Chae, 2021). According to Chae’s study with his peers, calcium-ions could move into and out of layered iron vanadate at room temperature, and held a capacity of 303 mAh per gram, which is not only the highest capacity recorded so far, but is even higher than common cathode materials used in lithium-ion batteries, which themselves hold a capacity between 150-250 mAh per gram. Additionally, iron vanadates are common compounds (Chae, 2021) which would help keep the price of the batteries low and the availability high. Another potential option is manganese oxide; while it has a much smaller capacity than layered iron vanadates – sitting around 100mAh per gram (Chando, 2023) - it makes up for it with a higher voltage, with 3.5V (Chando, 2023) as compared to the 2.6V (Chae, 2021) of layered iron vanadates. Beyond calcium, however, prominent alternatives include zinc, sodium, and aluminium. For example, zinc manganese oxide was studied by Dr. Dongliang Chao and his team, and they found it to have an extremely high capacity of 570mAh per gram despite a voltage of 1.95V, as well as holding low costs and high safety. Other such materials in batteries are still being researched, although aluminium does have a promising capacity of 2980mAh per gram and 3 electrons that can be lost, meanwhile sodium is an extremely common substance which is found even in table salt.

    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      This paper was a very brief study into battery technology, its chemistries, and the research being made into advancing beyond lithium-ion batteries. While many different materials hold good potential to become the mainstream substance used in batteries, none are as deeply researched and documented as calcium. It is very possible that another one of these chemistries will replace calcium in the future, but for now it is most likely that calcium will replace lithium in the immediate future. Nevertheless, it is too soon to guarantee that calcium will be the main substance; research is being invested into many different materials and a single breakthrough in finding a suitable cathode for an anode, one that is cheap, easy to produce, and high capacity, could very well make that material the improvement over lithium that has long been desired.
