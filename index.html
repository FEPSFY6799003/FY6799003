      As with all technology, batteries have been constantly improving, becoming safer and better over time. However, as other technologies advance and have higher power requirements, better batteries are needed to meet these demands. Several substances hold the potential to replace lithium, but perhaps the most prominent of them is calcium. Experimentally shown to have a specific capacity of 1337 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), slightly higher than current lithium-ion batteries with 372 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), and a higher abundance of calcium (Xu, 2021) means they would also be cheaper than lithium, despite the drawback of few suitable electrolytes limiting experimentation. Alternatives include magnesium, aluminium, and zinc-ions, each shown to have their own advantages and drawbacks when compared to lithium, and any of them could very well become the mainstream material in batteries depending on how research advances.

      Batteries have four main parts; the anode which receives ions and acts as the “negative” terminal (Warner, 2015), the cathode which releases ions and acts as the “positive” terminal (Warner, 2015), the separator which the ions flow through without letting the cathode and anode make contact with each other (Warner, 2015), and the electrolyte which allows this flow of ions and uses it to create a current, powering the circuit that the battery is connected to (Warner, 2015). This combination of cathode and anode is known as an electrode, and many electrodes are used to create a battery by wrapping them in a cylinder with many layers (Warner, 2015). Nowadays, the five most commonly used lithium-ion cathode chemistries are lithium-iron phosphate (LFP), lithium-manganese oxide (LMO), lithium titanate (LTO), lithium-cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt aluminium (NCA), and finally lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) (Warner, 2015). Each chemistry has its own advantages and disadvantages compared to the other four, ranging from its capacity to operating temperatures to price of production, meaning manufacturers often use them according to the required product and situation. For example, LFP is commonly used in automotives due to its high charge and discharge rates, relatively low cost of production, and high durability which makes it safer than other cathode chemistries available, despite its lower capacity (Warner, 2015). In terms of portable devices, LMO is a strong choice due to its high capacity and charge/discharge rates despite its shorter lifespan (Warner, 2015).

      Thanks to a combination of higher capacity and voltage, and a longer lifespan than its predecessor – lead acid batteries – it quickly took over the battery market (Warner, 2015). While lead acid has a capacity of between 15-20 mAh per gram (Warner, 2015), lithium-ions had a capacity of 3861 mAh per gram (Xu, 2021), a massive increase which meant longer lifespans for devices at much lower mass and size. Additionally, there was a longer lifespan with over 1000 cycles in almost all cathode chemistries with lithium-ions (Warner, 2015) compared to lead acid’s lifespan of 300-800 (Warner, 2015) cycles. This leap in battery technology greatly improved the capabilities of electronic devices, especially in the field of portable electronics due to the decreased mass of the batteries alongside a far greater capacity and lifespan. However, lithium is reaching its limits in terms of energy density and capacity (Gummow, 2018), and so research is being made into possible upgrades.
